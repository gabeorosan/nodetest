						As a small solo practice, <strong> I do not accept insurance directly</strong>, but I will provide you with a receipt with all the information you will need to seek reimbursement on your own. Check with your insurer to see about your mental health coverage for a fully licensed, out-of-network, Ph.D. clinical psychologist. Sessions are $150. Statements are send monthly, via a secure billing program, and payment is made online with an echeck or credit card.

					<p class="animate-right">
						I believe that <strong>regular weekly appointments</strong> are necessary to accomplish real change. Many people find that coming more often allows them to make deeper and more lasting changes. We will decide, together, the schedule that is right for you.
						Beginning therapy requires a significant commitment from you, to come regularly and pay for the spot you are reserving in the schedule. I try to be a good steward of my time, and use it well. Please keep in mind that other patients are turned away to make space for you, and only reserve appointments that you plan on keeping.

						Sessions are 45 minutes long and need to end promptly to keep the schedule on time for the following appointments. If the session is delayed or late in starting, this will shorten your time.

					<p class="animate-right">
						As a fully licensed clinical psychologist, I specialize in individual therapy for mood and eating disorders, maintaining a private practice in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  I have always enjoyed working with individuals struggling with a wide range of mood and eating issues.

						I have practiced for over 25 years as a therapist, and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to learn from many wonderful teachers, supervisors, and patients (of course).

						As a Harvard intern and fellow, I was exposed to a wide range of theoretical orientations and treatment modalities including cognitive behavioral, interpersonal, and psychoanalytic therapy, as well as trained in family therapy and group therapy. 

						My internship and post-doctoral fellowship at Beth Israel Hospital/Harvard Medical School included rotations in the emergency department, inpatient unit, pain service, and rape crisis consultation team.
