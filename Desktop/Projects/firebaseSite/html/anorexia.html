					<p class="animate-right">
						

						Anorexia is characterized by dramatic weight loss and an extremely restrictive pattern of eating. People suffering from Anorexia have an extreme fear of gaining weight and becoming fat, even though they are underweight. Their body weight is the primary factor in their sense of self-esteem. They engage in extensive body checking behaviors, such as looking in mirrors and weighing themselves,”checking” to see if they are fat. They may make repeated comments about feeling fat even though they have recently lost a dramatic amount of weight. They obsessively count their calories and avoid foods high in fat or sugar. They frequently become vegetarians. They often engage in excessive exercise, persisting even when they are injured or obstructed by foul weather. They may prepare a lot of food for other people, but not eat it themselves. They often try to avoid public and family meals, giving excuses as to why they can’t eat. They may cover up with baggy clothes. Purging behavior, such as excessive exercise or vomiting is seen in about 40% of cases.

						People with anorexia are often high in perfectionism, extremely hard working, very competitive and highly driven. They may show traits of obsessive compulsive disorder, with a great deal of personal rigidity and fears of dirt, mess and contamination. Many people with Anorexia have an extremely low sense of self worth and do not feel they deserve to eat. They often have trouble spending money on themselves. They can also have a significant degree of anxiety, and struggle with depression. They often become extremely withdrawn and irritable as the disorder progresses and will lash out at anyone who tries to stop them in their pursuit of extreme thinness.

					<h2 class="sub-headline">Physical Problems that Develop as Anorexia Progresses</h2>
					<p class="animate-right">
						As a person descends into anorexia, they have increasingly negative health problems that develop. The menstrual cycle will often be interrupted indicating a problem in calcium and hormone regulation. This problem in hormone and calcium regulation can signal that body is losing bone density through osteopenia and osteoporosis. The person feels cold all the time, as circulation shuts down due to low metabolic rate. They may develop a fine downy hair on their face and elsewhere. The digestive system can also slow down and the person can suffer with constipation. Their heart rate slows down to an abnormally low level and they risk having a dangerously irregular heart rhythm. They lose muscle mass and experience fatigue as their body metabolizes their muscles for fuel. They begin to have a great deal of difficulty with sleep. Occasionally they may experience a fainting spell, or lightheadedness.

					<h2 class="sub-headline">Typical Signs of Anorexia</h2>
					<p class="animate-right">
						1. Significant recent weight loss to the point that you are well below the average weight for your age and height
						<br>
						2. Restricting your eating to only “safe” foods like fruit, vegetables, and other low fat/low carb items
						<br>
						3. Eating alone due to a fear of eating with family, friends, or in public
						<br>
						4. Going a long time between meals or skipping meals
						<br>
						5. Weird food rituals like cutting food into tiny pieces or taking a very long time to eat
						<br>
						6. Obsession with nutrition facts, counting calories, and avoiding dietary fat
						<br>
						7. Being cold all the time, covering up with layers of clothes
						<br>
						8. Reading recipes, cooking excessively for others and not eating it yourself
						<br>
						9. Feeling fat even though you are underweight
						<br>
						10. Feeling like your self worth is based on how much you weigh
						<br><br>
						A missing or delayed menstrual period is another sign you may be suffering from Anorexia.
						Often the best treatment for Anorexia involves a team of people who specialize in the care of eating disorders, including an eating disorder therapist, a nutritionist, and a physician.

						If you or someone you love is showing symptoms of Anorexia, reach out for help. The problem does not easily go away on it’s own.
