                        Why Pay Privately

                        Like many experienced clinicians, I am not associated with any managed care or insurance companies. This means my clients pay privately to see me. There are many benefits associated with this policy.

                    When you use insurance to pay for therapy, you essentially invite the insurance company into the sessions with you. The insurance company can audit your treatment at any time, and examine all the confidential documentation of your treatment. Insurance companies monitor your diagnosis and evaluate your progress to make determinations about whether they will pay for your treatment. Insurance companies also require that the therapist notify your physician that you are in treatment. When you pay privately for treatment, your concerns stay off the record.*

					* Confidentiality exclusions include the duty to warn, the abuse of a minor, and a court order.

					<h2 class="sub-headline">Maintain Control of Treatment Decisions</h2>

					<p class="animate-right">
						
                    The best therapy evolves as you discuss the things that are important to you, – people you love, struggles you face, difficulties at work or home – the everyday challenges of life. You and your concerns should direct your treatment, not the insurance company.  Whether you are aware of it or not, when you use insurance to pay for your therapy, your insurance company intrudes into the therapy process. Insurance companies have extensive documentation requirements that don’t add value to your treatment. Insurance controls how many therapy sessions you can receive. The insurance company can retroactively take back all the money that they have paid for your treatment. Insurance requirements mean that the therapist ends up thinking about how to satisfy the insurance company, instead of concentrating on you, and what you want out of your treatment. When you pay for your own treatment, you control the decisions about it.

						When you use insurance to pay for your psychotherapy, you unknowingly initiate a reporting process that can come back to harm you. The Medical Information Bureau tracks your medical tests and results, your habits such as smoking, overeating, and drug use, as well as your hazardous hobbies and driving history. If you later apply for life insurance after receiving a psychiatric diagnosis you can be denied insurance coverage. Paying privately for treatment ensures that your problems remain your business, and are not posted on a governmental website for future insurers to see.

						Providers that are in insurance networks are often less experienced. Senior level clinicians with greater experience and expertise often choose not to take insurance payments due to the numerous limitations and regulations the insurance companies impose on a treatment. Paying privately for your treatment means you get the benefit of greater expertise and experience from a senior psychotherapist.
